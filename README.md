I experimented with the Llama2 7b-chat-hf model on Kaggle

Here are some key takeaways from this lesson: <br>
Principle 1: Craft Clear & Specific Instructions
Use clear and concise instructions to guide the model.
Use delimiters like quotes, brackets, and dashes to prevent "prompt injection" - unwanted user influence on the output. This ensures the model focuses on the task at hand, even if the user tries to deviate.
Structured Output format like JSON and HTML
Provide instructions to the model on how to handle edge cases.
Few-Shot Prompting to guide model's understanding.

Principle 2: Give model time to think
Break down complex tasks into manageable steps, allowing the model to process information thoroughly before jumping to conclusions.

Capabilities: summarization, transforming, inferencing including sentiment analysis and generating topics discussed in any piece of text.

After completion of the course, I created a custom chatbot called OrderBot for my non-existent Sunshine cafe.
Crafting Clear Prompts: Precise instructions & delimiters keep the model focused, even with tricky users
Structured Outputs & Few-Shot Learning: Structured formats & guiding the model with examples unlock powerful capabilities.
Give it Time to Think: Break down complex tasks for optimal results.
Used these learnings to create OrderBot for my (hypothetical) Sunshine Cafe
