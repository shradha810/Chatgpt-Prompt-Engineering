# Chatgpt-Prompt-Engineering
https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/chatgpt-prompt-eng/

I experimented the deeplearning.ai course with the Llama2 7b-chat-hf model on Kaggle <br>
I used the learnings from the course to create a custom chatbot called OrderBot for my non-existent Sunshine cafe. <br>

Here are some key takeaways from this Course: <br>
Principle 1: Craft Clear & Specific Instructions <br>
1. Use clear and concise instructions to guide the model. <br>
2. Use delimiters like quotes, brackets, and dashes to prevent "prompt injection" - unwanted user influence on the output. This ensures the model to focus on the task at hand, even if the user tries to deviate. <br>
3. Structured Output format like JSON and HTML. <br>
4. Provide instructions to the model on how to handle edge cases. <br>
5. Few-Shot Prompting to guide model's understanding. <br>

Principle 2: Give model time to think <br>
1. Break down complex tasks into manageable steps, allowing the model to process information thoroughly before jumping to conclusions. <br>

Capabilities of LLM models: summarization, transforming, inferencing including sentiment analysis and topic generation.
